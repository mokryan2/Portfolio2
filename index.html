                <p class="text-box">Howdy! My name is Ryan Mok. I am born and raised in Lincolnwood, IL, which is a
                    northern
                    suburb of Chicago that nearly everyone has never heard of. I am currently enrolled in
                    Northwestern University's full-stack coding program where I am learning how to become
                    a web-developer. Aside from working full time and attending class, most of my free time
                    is spent either being with my childhood friends, going to the gym, cooking, playing video
                    games, or playing my saxophone.
                </p>
                <p class="text-box"> I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014 where I
                    received
                    my Bachelor's of Fine Arts in Music; I was and still am a fairly large music nerd. I
                    was very active in the athletic bands program which included a Marching, Volleyball,
                    and Basketball Band that performed at every home game; I joined mostly becasue a lot
                    of my friends were also in them. University ensembles aside, I started an ad-hoc ensemble
                    known as Sixth Street Brass. Most of our music can be classified as "riot-jazz", but
                    we also wrote arrangements of popular music such as "No-Diggity" by Blackstreet (we found
                    a way to make it work).</p>
                <p class="text-box">I look at the coding world as I would a piece of music; there's an order to it,
                    there's a million ways to produce the end result, and there's always something new and refreshing
                    being
                    released to the public.</p>
